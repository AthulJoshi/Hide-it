## Contributing to Hide-it
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

### How Can I Contribute?
When you are ready to start work on an issue:

- Let us know by leaving a comment on the issue. (Also let us know later if you are no longer working on it.)
- Once you have been assigned the issue (or once you have claimed the issue) only then proceed to make the Pull Request. This will help avoid multiple PRs pertaining to the same issue.

If you don't see your idea/issue listed, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, you can directly open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new feature/enhancement, start by opening an issue first. This way, other people can be also involved in the discussion before you do any work.
